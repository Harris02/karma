          <div class="poin-penting">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
          <div class="paragraf">
            <p>Karma has pale skin, short red hair, and pale sharp eyes that appear as either mercury or goldish in color. Behind his usual innocent-looking, smiling face hides a torturous and rather sadistic personality. He has a slender build and has also been shown to have exceptionally sharp canine teeth.</p>
            <p>Among all the Class 3-E students, Karma is the only one to wear a black blazer as opposed to the standard school-issued uniform. In the anime, Karma is considered to be the most physically attractive out of all the boys in Class E by the girls.</p>
            <p>Seven years after graduation, Karma has grown considerably taller and has swept-back hair. His eyes also appear moderately less threatening.</p>
          </div>
          </div>
          <div class="poin-penting">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
          <div class="paragraf">
            <p> <a href="google.com" target="_blank">Karma</a> is well-known throughout the school for his violent behavior and troublesome attitude. He is quite cunning, mischievous, and somewhat sadistic, usually playing foul, tricking, and at times manipulating, humiliating and fighting others. He has been described by Karasuma as "at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes", and Itona has described him to have "certain vision" to Terasaka</p>
            <p>Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. However, he has become considerably more hard working at studying after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games. Unexpectedly, Karma is a fan of superhero movies, like Sonic Ninja.</p>
            <p>Despite his somewhat sadistic nature, Karma actually has good values behind his motives, and can be quite empathetic. The reason he was placed in Class E was that he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He is, unlike his former classmates, unprejudiced against Class E. He believes each and every one of them have their own special talents and will defend them, especially against Class A.</p>
            <p>When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, Karma began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result, he had almost zero respect for any adults. However, Karma has become more objective after meeting Korosensei, now respecting more of his opponents' and teachers' strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Karma has shown to be more than capable of respecting and caring for other people, as he greatly cares for Nagisa who seems to be his friend, and has grown attached to his classmates and others: he is best friends with Nagisa, he gets along with Okuda and Nakamura, often teases Terasaka, and respects Asano Gakushu and sees him as his intellectual rival. He also forms a bond with Korosensei, breaking down crying when he died. However, Karma also tends to be quite impulsive, to the point of becoming truly brutal and cruel when fighting with people who threaten him or any of his friends from Class E.</p>
          </div>
          </div>
          <div class="poin-penting">
            <h2>History</h2>
          <div class="paragraf">
            <p>Karma comes from a wealthy family, as his parents are successful financial day traders. They are "free people" who spend most of their time traveling around the world, and as a result, they spend little time with Karma.</p>
            <p>For a long time, Karma had been a rebellious student with a problematic attitude. However, due to his good grades, his homeroom teacher had supported him and proclaimed that "as long as you are in the right, sensei will be on your side".</p>
            <p>In his first two years at Kunigigaoka, Karma had been friends with fellow classmate Nagisa Shiota. He first approached Nagisa when he saw the latter reading an article about Karma's favourite film director adapting a comic book, and invited Nagisa to watch with him. For a short time, the two hung out together, with Karma being able to be less guarded with Nagisa. One day at a fast food outlet though, Nagisa unintentionally was able to sneak up on Karma. This made Karma feel exposed and vulnerable since Nagisa could have struck and killed him in that moment and he wouldn't have been able to react in time - something the strong and capable Karma wasn't used to. Karma sensed a mysterious but sinister feeling from Nagisa, but as he realized that he does not know how to deal with this (having being used to beating his problems with his fists). As a result, Karma distanced himself from Nagisa. By the time of his suspension, their relationship reverted back to being just classmates.</p>
            <p>One day Karma had found a senior from Class E being bullied and had jumped to his rescue, severely injuring the main building's 3rd year in the process. Convinced that he was still in the 'right', Karma was shocked when his homeroom teacher told him that he was in the 'wrong'. His teacher then further elaborated that he had no right to protect a "worthless piece of trash" from Class E and instead injured a fellow student with a "bright future", and told him that starting his third year he would be dropped to Class E. This caused the teacher's worth to 'die' in Karma's eyes, as well as causing Karma to stop caring about teachers in general and instead focused on doing what he wanted.</p>
